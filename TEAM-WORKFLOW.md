# 🤝 RemesaPay Team Collaboration Workflow

## 📋 **Current Team Setup**
- **You**: Working on frontend enhancements (`feature/frontend-enhancements` branch)
- **Partner**: Working on backend/contract fixes (`feature/backend-fixes` branch)
- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code only

## 🌿 **Branch Strategy**

### **Main Branches**
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch (optional for larger teams)

### **Feature Branches**
- `feature/frontend-enhancements` - UI/UX improvements (Your work)
- `feature/backend-fixes` - Backend error resolution (Partner's work)
- `feature/contract-optimizations` - Smart contract improvements
- `feature/wallet-integration` - Wallet connectivity features

## 🚀 **Workflow Steps**

### **For Your Partner (Backend/Contract Work):**

```bash
# 1. Create a new branch for backend fixes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/backend-fixes

# 2. Work on backend errors
# - Fix TypeScript errors in backend/src/routes/index.ts
# - Fix any contract compilation issues
# - Test backend endpoints

# 3. Commit work regularly
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve backend TypeScript errors in routes"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/backend-fixes

# 5. Create Pull Request when ready
```

### **For You (Frontend Work):**

```bash
# Already set up - continue working on:
# feature/frontend-enhancements branch

# Keep committing improvements
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add mobile responsiveness improvements"
git push origin feature/frontend-enhancements
```

## 🔄 **Staying in Sync**

### **Daily Sync Process:**
```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 2. Check what your partner committed
git log origin/feature/backend-fixes --oneline

# 3. If needed, merge latest main into your branch
git checkout feature/frontend-enhancements
git merge origin/main

# 4. Continue your work
```

### **Integration Process:**
```bash
# When both features are ready:

# 1. Partner merges backend fixes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/backend-fixes
git push origin main

# 2. You update your branch with latest main
git checkout feature/frontend-enhancements
git pull origin main
git merge main

# 3. You merge frontend enhancements
git checkout main
git merge feature/frontend-enhancements
git push origin main
```

## 📂 **File Ownership to Avoid Conflicts**

### **Your Focus Areas (Frontend):**
```
frontend/
├── src/app/page.tsx ← Your main file
├── src/components/ ← UI components
├── src/styles/ ← CSS/styling
└── public/ ← Static assets
```

### **Partner's Focus Areas (Backend/Contracts):**
```
backend/
├── src/routes/ ← API endpoints
├── src/services/ ← Business logic
└── src/types/ ← TypeScript definitions

contracts/
├── contracts/ ← Smart contracts
├── test/ ← Contract tests
└── scripts/ ← Deployment scripts
```

### **Shared Areas (Coordinate Before Editing):**
```
├── README.md ← Update together
├── package.json ← Coordinate dependency changes
├── .env files ← Share configuration changes
└── docker-compose.yml ← Infrastructure changes
```

## 🚨 **Conflict Resolution**

### **If You Both Edit the Same File:**
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. If conflicts occur:
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# 3. Edit conflicted files manually
# Look for markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

# 4. Test the merged code
npm run dev

# 5. Commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflict in [filename]"
```

## 📱 **Communication Workflow**

### **Before Starting Work:**
1. **Check**: What is your partner working on?
2. **Announce**: "I'm working on [feature] in [files]"
3. **Coordinate**: Avoid editing the same files simultaneously

### **During Work:**
1. **Commit Often**: Small, focused commits
2. **Push Regularly**: At least daily
3. **Update**: Pull partner's changes daily

### **When Ready to Merge:**
1. **Test**: Ensure your feature works independently
2. **Review**: Check your partner's code
3. **Merge**: One person at a time
4. **Verify**: Test the integrated system

## 🛠️ **Current Project Status**

### **Frontend (Your Work) ✅ DONE:**
- [x] Professional UI design implemented
- [x] Ecuador-themed styling
- [x] Responsive design with animations
- [x] Enhanced calculator and hero section
- [x] Wallet integration UI

### **Backend (Partner's Work) 🔄 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in routes/index.ts
- [ ] Resolve Express middleware issues
- [ ] Fix WalletService.getClient() method
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Test API endpoints

### **Next Integration Steps:**
1. Partner completes backend fixes
2. Both branches tested independently
3. Merge backend fixes to main
4. Merge frontend enhancements to main
5. Full system integration testing

## 📞 **Emergency Procedures**

### **If Something Breaks:**
```bash
# 1. Don't panic - Git saves everything
git log --oneline  # See recent commits

# 2. Revert to last working state
git checkout [commit-hash]

# 3. Create new branch from working state
git checkout -b emergency/fix-issue

# 4. Fix and test
# 5. Merge back when stable
```

### **Quick Help Commands:**
```bash
git status                    # What's changed?
git log --oneline -10        # Recent commits
git branch -a                # All branches
git diff main                # What's different from main?
git stash                    # Temporarily save changes
git stash pop                # Restore stashed changes
```
